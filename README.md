# PCAP #1 

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
On Saturday 2018-06-30 at 20:27 UTC, we received alerts indicating a Windows computer used
by Lloyd Maxwell downloaded malware disguised as an update to Chrome from a fake Google
Chrome update page. Further investigation revealed the user was possibly infected with Dridex
due to this activity.

## DETAILS:
• IP address: 172.16.2.169
• MAC address: 00:13:92:06:5c:7b
• Host name: Conservator-PC
• User account name: lloyd.maxwell

## INDICATORS:
• 93.95.100.178 port 80 - lw2e.sineadhollywoodnutt.com - various HTTP requests for fake
Chrome update page
• 93.95.100.138 port 80 - bb17eb22.login3.kimbrelelectric.com - POST /blank.gif
• 107.170.231.118 port 4143 - IP and TCP port associated with Dridex (Feodo) - attempted
TCP connections, but no response from the server

## DETAILS
As always, I recommend you set up Wireshark according to the tutorials I've documented at:
• http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/tutorials/index.html
First, is this a Windows host? It sure is!
Filter on http.request and !(udp.port eq 1900) to see some of the HTTP GET requests at the
beginning of this pcap. Follow any of the first few HTTP GET requests to
www.stmarybahrain.com, and you'll see Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64 listed in the User-
Agent string. Windows NT 6.1 represents Windows 7. This is also Google Chrome being used
as the web browser.
Shown above: Filtering on http.request and !(udp.port eq 1900) and following one of the TCP streams.
